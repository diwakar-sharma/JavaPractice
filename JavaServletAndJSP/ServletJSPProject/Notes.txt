Why jsp not servlet:
	UI desinet are not familiar with java coding they are familiar with html.

-- JSP Tags -- 
Declaration: 
	whenever we need to write outside service method like writing java method and declaring globle veriable for jsp servlet.
	<%!   %>

Directive: whenever we need to import external package or other external tag.
	<%@   %>
	Different directive:
	@page : when you want to something for entire page like setting language,package import and exception handling of the page.
		<%@ page attributeName="attributeValue" attributeName="attributeValue" ...%>
		attributeName="attributeValue"
		import="importlist" 
		language="scripting language(default java)"
		session= "true|false"
		contentType="html json image video"
		extends="class name"
		autoflush="true|false(if dont want get buffer full)"  
		errorPage="eeropage url"
		isErrorPage="true|false"

	@include :when we want to add some external file in jsp.
		import="filepath"

	@taglib: to add external tag
 
Scriplet: Whatever we write in scriplet will be the part of service method.
	<%  %>

Expression:Whatever we write in expresion will be set as String in out.println.
	<%=  %>

Impicit object in jsp(Built In Object): can be used in expression and scriptlet
